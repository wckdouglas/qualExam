In laboratory animals, however, the imaging of spontaneously occurring tumors continues to pose many technical and logistical problems. Recently a mouse model was generated in which a chimeric protein consisting of HIF-1α oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) fused to luciferase was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues. Hypoxic stress leads to the accumulation of ODD-luciferase in the tissues of this mouse model which can be identified by non-invasive bioluminescence measurement. Since solid tumors often contain hypoxic regions, we performed proof-of-principle experiments testing whether this transgenic mouse model may be used as a universal platform for non-invasive imaging analysis of spontaneous solid tumors.</p> </sec> <sec> <title>Methods and Materials</title> <p><italic>ODD-luciferase</italic> transgenic mice were bred with <italic>MMTV-neu/beclin1+/−</italic> mice. Upon injection of luciferin, bioluminescent background of normal tissues in the transgenic mice and bioluminescent signals from spontaneously mammary carcinomas were measured non-invasively with an IVIS Spectrum imaging station. Tumor volumes were measured manually and the histology of tumor tissues was analyzed.</p> </sec> <sec> <title>Conclusion</title> <p>Our results show that spontaneous mammary tumors in ODD-luciferase transgenic mice generate substantial bioluminescent signals, which are clearly discernable from background tissue luminescence. Moreover, we demonstrate a strong quantitative correlation between the bioluminescent tumor contour and the volume of palpable tumors. We further demonstrate that shrinkage of the volume of spontaneous tumors in response to chemotherapeutic treatment can be determined quantitatively using this system. Finally, we show that the growth and development of spontaneous tumors can be monitored longitudinally over several weeks. Thus, our results suggest that this model could potentially provide a practical, reliable, and cost-effective non-invasive quantitative method for imaging spontaneous solid tumors in mice.</p> </sec>},

@article{Ameri:2010qf,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Tumours contain hypoxic regions that select for an aggressive cell phenotype; tumour hypoxia induces metastasis-associated genes. Treatment refractory patients with metastatic cancer show increased numbers of circulating tumour cells (CTCs), which are also associated with disease progression. The aim of this study was to examine the as yet unknown relationship between hypoxia and CTCs. METHODS:: We generated human MDA-MB-231 orthotopic xenografts and, using a new technology, isolated viable human CTCs from murine blood. The CTCs and parental MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated at 21 and 0.2{\%} (hypoxia) oxygen, respectively. Colony formation was assayed and levels of hypoxia- and anoxia-inducible factors were measured. Xenografts generated from CTCs and parental cells were compared. RESULTS:: MDA-MB-231 xenografts used to generate CTCs were hypoxic, expressing hypoxia factors: hypoxia-inducible factor1 alpha (HIF1α) and glucose transporter protein type 1 (GLUT1), and anoxia-induced factors: activating transcription factor 3 and 4 (ATF3 and ATF4). Parental MDA-MB-231 cells induced ATF3 in hypoxia, whereas CTCs expressed it constitutively. Asparagine synthetase (ASNS) expression was also higher in CTCs. Hypoxia induced ATF4 and the HIF1αtarget gene apelin in CTCs, but not in parental cells. Hypoxia induced lower levels of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), GLUT1 and BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19-KD protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) proteins in CTCs than in parental cells, supporting an altered hypoxia response. In chronic hypoxia, CTCs demonstrated greater colony formation than parental cells. Xenografts generated from CTCs were larger and heavier, and metastasised faster than MDA-MB-231 xenografts. CONCLUSION:: CTCs show an altered hypoxia response and an enhanced aggressive phenotype in vitro and in vivo.},

	Abstract = {Circulating tumor cells (CTC) are emerging as a powerful prognostic and predictive biomarker in several types of cancer, including breast, colon, and prostate. Studies of CTC in metastasis and further development of CTC as a biomarker in cancer have been limited by the inability to repetitively monitor CTC in mouse models of cancer. We have validated a method to enumerate CTC in blood samples obtained from living mice using a modified version of an in vitro diagnostic system for quantifying CTC in patients. Different routes of blood collection were tested to identify a method to reproducibly recover CTC from tumor-bearing mice without interference from contaminating normal murine epithelial cells. CTC are present in blood samples from mice bearing orthotopic xenografts of several different breast cancer cell lines and primary breast cancer cells from patient biopsies. We also show that this technology can be used for serial monitoring of CTC in mouse xenograft models of human breast cancer. These results establish a new method for studying CTC in mouse models of epithelial cancer, providing the foundation for studies of molecular regulation of CTC in cancer and CTC as biomarker for therapeutic efficacy.},

@article{23496980,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:High invasion and metastasis are the primary factors causing poor prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these biological behaviors have not been completely elucidated. In this study, we investigate the molecular mechanism by which hypoxia promotes HCC invasion and metastasis through inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).METHODS:The expression of EMT markers was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Effect of hypoxia on induction of EMT and ability of cell migration and invasion were performed. Luciferase reporter system was used for evaluation of Snail regulation by hypoxia-inducible factor -1alpha (HIF-1alpha).RESULTS:We found that overexpression of HIF-1alpha was observed in HCC liver tissues and was related to poor prognosis of HCC patients. HIF-1alpha expression profile was correlated with the expression levels of SNAI1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin. Hypoxia was able to induce EMT and enhance ability of invasion and migration in HCC cells. The same phenomena were also observed in CoCl2-treated cells. The shRNA-mediated HIF-1alpha suppression abrogated CoCl2-induced EMT and reduced ability of migration and invasion in HCC cells. Luciferase assay showed that HIF-1alpha transcriptional regulated the expression of SNAI1 based on two hypoxia response elements (HREs) in SNAI1 promoter.CONCLUSIONS:We demonstrated that hypoxia-stabilized HIF1alpha promoted EMT through increasing SNAI1 transcription in HCC cells. This data provided a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.},

	Abstract = {Tumor hypoxia has been reported to induce tumor progression in several carcinomas. Current studies have shown that hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is stabilized under hypoxic conditions and transactivates various genes related to cancer aggressiveness. In the present study, we examined whether hypoxia affects cancer invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to solve the molecular mechanism of tumor invasion under the hypoxic condition. We showed that tumor hypoxia accelerated cancer invasion in two hepatoma cell lines. Using Western blot and RT-PCR analyses we demonstrated striking evidence that the expression of HIF-1alpha, ETS-1, MMP-7 and MT1-MMP was strongly upregulated by hypoxic stimulation. To examine whether these invasion-related genes are regulated by HIF-1alpha, we treated hepatoma cells with TX-402, which was reported to repress HIF-1alpha expression. HIF-1alpha expression was strongly repressed by the TX-402 treatment. In contrast, the expression of ETS-1, MMP-7 and MT1-MMP mRNA was not affected by TX-402 treatment. We further established stable transfectants in which HIF-1alpha dominant negative vector was introduced into Hep3B cells (pHIF-1alphaDN). In the pHIF-1alphaDN cells, the expression of ETS-1, MMP-7 and MT1-MMP was not repressed. Moreover, the invasion activity of pHIF-1alphaDN was not altered, compared with that of the mock. In hepatoma cells, we provided evidence that hypoxic stress accelerates cancer invasion by upregulating ETS-1 and the MMP family by an HIF-1alpha-independent pathway.},

Our results show that the siRNA targeted against KRAS mutations with a local prolonged release system knocks down KRAS expression in vitro and in vivo, leading to an antitumor effect. Our report describes an applicable and efficient delivery method of siRNA that overcomes the major obstacles of toxicity and organ accessibility.

In this protocol, we describe the procedure for isolating rare CTCs from blood samples by using tumor antigen--independent microfluidic CTC-iChip technology. The CTC-iChip uses deterministic lateral displacement, inertial focusing and magnetophoresis to sort up to 107 cells/s. By using two-stage magnetophoresis and depletion antibodies against leukocytes, we achieve 3.8-log depletion of white blood cells and a 97{\%} yield of rare cells with a sample processing rate of 8 ml of whole blood/h. The CTC-iChip is compatible with standard cytopathological and RNA-based characterization methods. This protocol describes device production, assembly, blood sample preparation, system setup and the CTC isolation process. Sorting 8 ml of blood sample requires 2 h including setup time, and chip production requires 2--5 d.},

	Abstract = {Activating KRAS mutations and p16(Ink4a) inactivation are near universal events in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In mouse models, Kras(G12D) initiates formation of premalignant pancreatic ductal lesions, and loss of either Ink4a/Arf (p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf)) or p53 enables their malignant progression. As recent mouse modeling studies have suggested a less prominent role for p16(Ink4a) in constraining malignant progression, we sought to assess the pathological and genomic impact of inactivation of p16(Ink4a), p19(Arf), and/or p53 in the Kras(G12D) model. Rapidly progressive PDAC was observed in the setting of homozygous deletion of either p53 or p16(Ink4a), the latter with intact germ-line p53 and p19(Arf) sequences. Additionally, Kras(G12D) in the context of heterozygosity either for p53 plus p16(Ink4a) or for p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf) produced PDAC with longer latency and greater propensity for distant metastases relative to mice with homozygous deletion of p53 or p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf). Tumors from the double-heterozygous cohorts showed frequent p16(Ink4a) inactivation and loss of either p53 or p19(Arf). Different genotypes were associated with specific histopathologic characteristics, most notably a trend toward less differentiated features in the homozygous p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf) mutant model. High-resolution genomic analysis revealed that the tumor suppressor genotype influenced the specific genomic patterns of these tumors and showed overlap in regional chromosomal alterations between murine and human PDAC. Collectively, our results establish that disruptions of p16(Ink4a) and the p19(ARF)-p53 circuit play critical and cooperative roles in PDAC progression, with specific tumor suppressor genotypes provocatively influencing the tumor biological phenotypes and genomic profiles of the resultant tumors.},

@article{Wenger:1997fk,
	Abstract = {The hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is involved in the induction of oxygen regulated genes such as erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor consisting of an alpha and a beta subunit. The question of how HIF-1 itself is regulated remains to be elucidated. Studies performed in human Hep3B hepatoma cells suggested that the prevalent mode of HIF-1 action is an increase in HIF-1 alpha steady-state mRNA and protein levels after hypoxic exposure. In contrast to the reported very low basal HIF-1 alpha mRNA levels, however, we detected HIF-1 alpha mRNA in several cell lines cultured under normoxic conditions, although no HIF-1 DNA binding activity was observed. Following hypoxic induction, VEGF mRNA levels and HIF-1 DNA binding activity increased, but HIF-1 alpha mRNA levels remained largely unchanged. One possible explanation for this discrepancy might be that HIF-1 DNA binding activity does not follow HIF-1 alpha mRNA kinetics. We therefore incubated HeLaS3 cells in tonometers for 7.5 minutes up to four hours at either 20% O2 or 0.5% O2. Although there was some variation in HIF-1 alpha mRNA levels, we did not find significant changes over this time frame, suggesting that HIF-1 alpha is not transcriptionally regulated.},

	Abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) transactivates genes the products of which mediate tumor angiogenesis and glycolytic metabolism. Overexpression of the HIF-1 alpha subunit, resulting from intratumoral hypoxia and genetic alterations, has been demonstrated in common human cancers and is correlated with tumor angiogenesis and patient mortality. Here we demonstrate that hypoxia or HIF-1 alpha overexpression stimulates Matrigel invasion by HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells, whereas this process is inhibited by a small interfering RNA directed against HIF-1 alpha. We show that HIF-1 regulates the expression of genes encoding cathepsin D; matrix metalloproteinase 2; urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR); fibronectin 1; keratins 14, 18, and 19; vimentin; transforming growth factor alpha; and autocrine motility factor, which are proteins that play established roles in the pathophysiology of invasion. Neutralizing antibodies against uPAR block tumor cell invasion induced by hypoxia or HIF-1 alpha overexpression. These results provide a molecular basis for promotion of the invasive cancer phenotype by hypoxia and/or HIF-1 alpha overexpression.},

	Abstract = {Hypoxia occurs frequently in human cancers and induces adaptive changes in cell metabolism that include a switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, increased glycogen synthesis, and a switch from glucose to glutamine as the major substrate for fatty acid synthesis. This broad metabolic reprogramming is coordinated at the transcriptional level by HIF-1, which functions as a master regulator to balance oxygen supply and demand. HIF-1 is also activated in cancer cells by tumor suppressor (e.g., VHL) loss of function and oncogene gain of function (leading to PI3K/AKT/mTOR activity) and mediates metabolic alterations that drive cancer progression and resistance to therapy. Inhibitors of HIF-1 or metabolic enzymes may impair the metabolic flexibility of cancer cells and make them more sensitive to anticancer drugs.},

	Abstract = {Of the deaths attributed to cancer, 90{\%} are due to metastasis, and treatments that prevent or cure metastasis remain elusive. Emerging data indicate that hypoxia and the extracellular matrix (ECM) might have crucial roles in metastasis. During tumour evolution, changes in the composition and the overall content of the ECM reflect both its biophysical and biological properties and these strongly influence tumour and stromal cell properties, such as proliferation and motility. Originally thought of as independent contributors to metastatic spread, recent studies have established a direct link between hypoxia and the composition and the organization of the ECM, which suggests a new model in which multiple microenvironmental signals might converge to synergistically influence metastatic outcome.},

	Abstract = {Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-associated death but has been difficult to study because it involves a series of rare, stochastic events. To capture these events, we developed a sensitive method to tag and track pancreatic epithelial cells in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Tagged cells invaded and entered the bloodstream unexpectedly early, before frank malignancy could be detected by rigorous histologic analysis; this behavior was widely associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Circulating pancreatic cells maintained a mesenchymal phenotype, exhibited stem cell properties, and seeded the liver. EMT and invasiveness were most abundant at inflammatory foci, and induction of pancreatitis increased the number of circulating pancreatic cells. Conversely, treatment with the immunosuppressive agent dexamethasone abolished dissemination. These results provide insight into the earliest events of cellular invasion in situ and suggest that inflammation enhances cancer progression in part by facilitating EMT and entry into the circulation.},

CSC<sup>high</sup> cells exhibited high basal expression of the mesenchymal Vimentin protein but low or absent expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, with the opposite result in CSC<sup>low</sup> cells. Hypoxia triggered altering of cell morphology from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype, which was more pronounced in CSC<sup>high</sup> cells. Concomitantly, E-cadherin expression was reduced and expression of Vimentin, Slug, Twist2 and Zeb1 enhanced. While hypoxia caused migration in all cell lines, velocity along with the percentage of migrating, polarized and pseudopodia-forming cells was significantly higher in CSC<sup>high</sup> cells. These data indicate that hypoxia-induced EMT occurs in PDA and several other tumor entities. However although hypoxia-induced EMT signaling occurs in all tumor cell populations, only the stem-like cells acquire high migratory potential and thus may be responsible for invasion and metastasis.</p>},

	Abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancers with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5{\%}. Moreover, PDAC escapes early detection and resists treatment. Multiple combinations of genetic alterations are known to occur in PDAC including mutational activation of KRAS, inactivation of p16/CDKN2A and SMAD4 (DPC4) and dysregulation of PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling. Through their interaction with Wingless-INT pathway, the downstream molecules of these pathways have been implicated in the promotion of epithelial--mesenchymal transition (EMT). Emerging evidence has demonstrated that cancer stem cells (CSCs), small populations of which have been identified in PDAC, and EMT-type cells play critical roles in drug resistance, invasion, and metastasis in pancreatic cancer. EMT may be histologically represented by the presence of tumor budding which is described as the occurrence of single tumor cells or small clusters (<5) of dedifferentiated cells at the invasive front of gastrointestinal (including colorectal, oesophageal, gastric, and ampullary) carcinomas and is linked to poor prognosis. Tumor budding has recently been shown to occur frequently in PDAC and to be associated with adverse clinicopathological features and decreased disease-free and overall survival. The aim of this review is to present a short overview on the morphological and molecular aspects that underline the relationship between tumor budding cells, CSCs, and EMT-type cells in PDAC.},

	Abstract = {Tumors are cellularly and molecularly heterogeneous, with subsets of undifferentiated cancer cells exhibiting stem cell-like features (CSCs). Epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT) are transdifferentiation programs that are required for tissue morphogenesis during embryonic development. The EMT process can be regulated by a diverse array of cytokines and growth factors, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, whose activities are dysregulated during malignant tumor progression. Thus, EMT induction in cancer cells results in the acquisition of invasive and metastatic properties. Recent reports indicate that the emergence of CSCs occurs in part as a result of EMT, for example, through cues from tumor stromal components. Recent evidence now indicates that EMT of tumor cells not only causes increased metastasis, but also contributes to drug resistance. In this review, we will provide potential mechanistic explanations for the association between EMT induction and the emergence of CSCs. We will also highlight recent studies implicating the function of TGF-beta-regulated noncoding RNAs in driving EMT and promoting CSC self-renewal. Finally we will discuss how EMT and CSCs may contribute to drug resistance, as well as therapeutic strategies to overcome this clinically.},

Thus, genetic and/or epigenetic deregulation of metastasis suppressor genes (MSG) is a likely event during early pancreatic carcinogenesis and a potential diagnostic marker for the disease. We investigated 9 known MSGs for their role in the dissemination of PDAC and examined their promoters for methylation and its use in PDAC detection.METHODS:MRNA expression of 9 MSGs was determined in 18 PDAC cell lines by quantitative RT-PCR and promoter methylation was analyzed by Methylation Specific PCR and validated by Bisulfite Sequencing PCR. These data were compared to the cell lines' in vivo metastatic and invasive potential that had been previously established. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 20 using 2-tailed Spearman's correlation with P<0.05 being considered significant.RESULTS:Complete downregulation of MSG-mRNA expression in PDAC cell lines vs. normal pancreatic RNA occurred in only 1 of 9 investigated genes. 3 MSGs (CDH1, TIMP3 and KiSS-1) were significantly methylated. Methylation only correlated to loss of mRNA expression in CDH1 (P<0.05). Bisulfite Sequencing PCR showed distinct methylation patterns, termed constant and variable methylation, which could distinguish methylation-regulated from non methylation-regulated genes. Higher MSG mRNA-expression did not correlate to less aggressive PDAC-phenotypes (P>0.14).CONCLUSIONS:Genes with metastasis suppressing functions in other tumor entities did not show evidence of assuming the same role in PDAC. Inactivation of MSGs by promoter methylation was an infrequent event and unsuitable as a diagnostic marker of PDAC. A distinct methylation pattern was identified, that resulted in reduced mRNA expression in all cases. Thus, constant methylation patterns could predict regulatory significance of a promoter's methylation prior to expression analysis and hence present an additional tool during target gene selection.},

@article{Hanahan2011646,
	Abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list---reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the ``tumor microenvironment.'' Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. },

	Abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States with a median survival of <6 mo and a dismal 5-yr survival rate of 3%--5%. The cancer's lethal nature stems from its propensity to rapidly disseminate to the lymphatic system and distant organs. This aggressive biology and resistance to conventional and targeted therapeutic agents leads to a typical clinical presentation of incurable disease at the time of diagnosis. The well-defined serial histopathologic picture and accompanying molecular profiles of PDAC and its precursor lesions have provided the framework for emerging basic and translational research. Recent advances include insights into the cancer's cellular origins, high-resolution genomic profiles pointing to potential new therapeutic targets, and refined mouse models reflecting both the genetics and histopathologic evolution of human PDAC. This confluence of developments offers the opportunity for accelerated discovery and the future promise of improved treatment.},
